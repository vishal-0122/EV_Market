# EV Market Segmentation using Clustering  

## Overview  
This project analyzes the **Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market** to identify the most promising **customer segment for an EV SUV**. Using **K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering**, we segment customers based on **Age and Income** to derive actionable insights for market entry.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Increased granularity for **Age Group** and **Income Level**  
   - Standardized numerical features  
2. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - **K-Means Clustering** (Optimal K selection using Elbow Method)  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering** (Dendrogram for cluster hierarchy)  
   - **DBSCAN** (Density-based clustering for noise identification)  
3. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - **Bar plots, Boxplots, Heatmaps, and Pairplots** for segment analysis  
   - Identified **Middle-aged & Mid-income customers** as the best target segment  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  

## Conclusion  
The analysis revealed that **Middle-aged & Mid-income individuals** are the **best potential customers** for an **EV SUV**, considering their **financial capability, lifestyle, and EV adoption potential**.
